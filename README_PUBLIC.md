# LineLink Product Overview

LineLink helps landlords manage Roma and NUL area line-houses remotely while helping room seekers find vacant rooms without walking around the village.

## Problem

Room seekers often discover vacancies by physically asking around. Landlords and caretakers manage tenants, rent, applications, and maintenance through informal calls, messages, and paper records. LineLink brings those workflows into one controlled system.

## Key Features

- Public vacant room finder
- Landlord property and room management
- Tenant onboarding by application and landlord approval
- Occupancy tracking
- Rent dues and payment submissions
- Support tickets and maintenance visibility
- Notifications and audit logs
- Role-based access control for admins, landlords, caretakers, and tenants

## Roles

- Admin: platform oversight
- Landlord: owns properties, rooms, listings, tenants, payments, and applications
- Caretaker: acts within an assigned landlord/property scope
- Tenant: sees only their own tenant portal data
- Public visitor: browses public listings and applies for a specific room

## Public Room Finder

Public users can browse vacant rooms, filter by location, price, room type, and room size, view details, request a viewing, and apply for a specific listing.

## Tenant Onboarding Workflow

1. Public user finds a vacant room listing.
2. User applies under that exact listing.
3. The application is tied to `listing_id`, `room_id`, `property_id`, and `landlord_id` through the listing.
4. Landlord or assigned caretaker reviews the application.
5. Approval can lead to tenant account creation or linking.
6. Assignment creates an occupancy, marks the room occupied, hides the listing, and starts rent dues.

## Multi-Tenant Security

LineLink treats every line-house or apartment as belonging to one landlord. Landlord and caretaker routes are filtered by landlord scope. Tenants can access only their own data. Public listings are the only public records.

## Deployment Overview

- Backend: FastAPI on Render with PostgreSQL and Alembic migrations.
- Frontend: React/Vite on Vercel.
- Secrets: provided through Render and Vercel environment variables, not committed to Git.

## Production Admin Setup

LineLink does not rely on demo users in production. On Render, the backend start command runs migrations and then `python -m app.seed`.

With:

```env
APP_ENV=production
SEED_DEMO_DATA=false
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
ADMIN_FULL_NAME=LineLink Admin
```

the seed script creates only the first admin if needed and skips landlord, tenant, listing, payment, and ticket demo records.

## Render Backend Deployment

Build command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start command:

```bash
alembic upgrade head && python -m app.seed && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

Required backend environment variables:

```env
APP_ENV=production
SEED_DEMO_DATA=false
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
ADMIN_FULL_NAME=LineLink Admin
DATABASE_URL=Render PostgreSQL URL
SECRET_KEY=secure-random-secret
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app
PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-render-backend.onrender.com
```

Run deployment validation:

```bash
python -m app.validate_deployment --health-url https://your-render-backend.onrender.com/health
```

## Vercel Frontend Deployment

Set:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-render-backend.onrender.com
```

Use Vite defaults:

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`

## Security Notes

- Never use `ChangeMe123!` in production.
- Never expose or commit `.env`.
- Rotate `SECRET_KEY` before production.
- Keep demo seed data only for local or staging deployments.
- Keep `SEED_DEMO_DATA=false` for production.

## Deployment Troubleshooting

- If Render uses Python 3.14 and `pydantic-core` fails while building Rust dependencies, force Python 3.11.9. This repository pins the backend with `backend/runtime.txt` and `backend/.python-version`.

## Post-Deployment Test Checklist

1. Backend `/health` returns `200`.
2. Swagger `/docs` opens on the backend.
3. Vercel frontend can call `GET /public/listings` without CORS errors.
4. Production admin can log in.
5. Public users can submit viewing requests and applications under a listing.
6. Landlord/caretaker can approve, reject, request info, and assign an application.
7. Assignment creates an occupancy, marks the room occupied, and hides the public listing.

## Roadmap

- Mobile app with React Native/Expo
- Lease documents and digital signatures
- SMS and email delivery for invitations
- Rich maintenance work orders
- Billing dashboard for platform subscriptions
- Room photos and document upload improvements
